## First of all...
# Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

However, there are some guidelines for making pull requests. 
1) We value scalability and clean code over everything else.
2) The pull request should contain why this addition should be helpful.
3) Any dependencies that you wish to add, please state the version of the latest compatible release.
4) Make sure there are tests for your code.
